# Welcome to the Village of Hommlet

Barely large enough to be called a proper ‘village,’ the village of Hommlet has grown up around a crossroads on the edge of a vast wood. Once far from any important activity, it became embroiled in the struggle between gods and demons when the Temple of Elemental Evil arose but a few leagues away. Luckily for its inhabitants, the Temple and its evil hordes were destroyed a decade ago, but Hommlet still suffers from incursions of bandits and strange monsters…


# Welcome to the Barrowmaze

Local villagers whisper of a mysterious place deep in the marsh — a place shrouded in mist and dotted with barrow mounds, ruined columns, and standing stones. The tomb-robbers who explore beneath the mounds, or rather the few who return, tell tales of labyrinthine passages, magnificent grave goods, and terrifying creatures waiting in the dark.
