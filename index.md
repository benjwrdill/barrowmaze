## Welcome to The Barrowmaze

#### A classic fantasy megadungon

Local villagers whisper of a mysterious
place deep in the marsh -- a place
shrouded in mist and dotted with
barrow mounds, ruined columns, and
standing stones. The tomb-robbers
who explore beneath the mounds, or
rather the few who return, tell tales of
labyrinthine passages, magnificent grave
goods, and terrifying creatures waiting
in the dark.

#### Are you brave (or foolish) enough to enter Barrowmaze?
